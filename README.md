"This project is a Classic Snake Game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake using arrow keys, guiding it to eat food that appears randomly on the grid. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer, increasing the challenge of avoiding collisions with walls or itself.

The game is designed to be simple yet engaging, making it a perfect project for beginners and enthusiasts looking to improve their JavaScript skills. It demonstrates essential concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, timers, and basic game logic. The CSS is used to style the game board and snake, providing smooth animations and a visually appealing interface.

Playing this Snake Game is both nostalgic and fun, offering a classic arcade experience directly in the browser. It also provides a hands-on way to understand how real-time interactions are managed in JavaScript, including updating the game state, checking collisions, and rendering the snake dynamically.

This project can be easily expanded with features like increasing speed levels, adding sound effects, keeping score, or designing a mobile-friendly version. It’s a great addition to any portfolio as it reflects both creativity and practical coding skills.

Whether you are learning JavaScript for the first time or looking to polish your front-end development abilities, this Snake Game project provides a practical and interactive way to enhance your understanding of programming fundamentals while having fun."
