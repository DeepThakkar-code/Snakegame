# Snakegame
"This project is a Classic Snake Game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake using arrow keys, guiding it to eat food that appears randomly on the grid. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer, increasing the challenge of avoiding collisions with walls or itself.
